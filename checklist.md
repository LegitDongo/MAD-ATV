If your box is having issues, make sure you've checked all of these possible issues:
1. Does your device have 2GB of RAM?
    * There's no QA done on these boxes, so sometimes it is shipped without one embedded stick or with a malfunctioning one.
2. Are you sure your device is for that ROM? 
    * Sometimes they ship with the wrong board, and therefore the ROM you thought worked, actually only works with another one.
    * If necessary, check the motherboard
